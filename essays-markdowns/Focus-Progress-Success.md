We default to measuring success by wealth, accolades or status, but those scales are as subjective as they are seductive. A long walk, worth of introspection, can uncover one’s definition of success, which is basically what makes you happy. It could be Scrooge McDuck level riches to swim in, or simply being in great health at age 90. Mine is accumulating amazing dinner stories that get begged to be repeated as I sit for dinner, surrounded by friends and family to share them with. 


Meaningful progress toward success tends to come in two ways:

Plain old luck. You could win the lottery (however slim the odds), the love of your life happens to be your neighbour, or you could have bought 100 bitcoins a decade ago as a joke.

Second, doing hard things, which is different from hard work and requires sustained focus over long durations of time, and courage.


In my own struggle to maintain focus on hard things, I discovered three things.

Our vantage point is not high enough. We rarely look far into the future. Fear and unease pull our horizon closer to the present. The future starts to feel too uncertain, too far off to plan for. So we shrink our view down to the next few weeks or months. Even when we try to think long-term, we rarely account for compounding factors. We default to linear thinking, which defeats the purpose. 

There’s no daily forcing function that pushes us to make tradeoffs. We just keep piling initiatives onto our list: The easy wins, the short-term ROI tasks, and the things that feel urgent in the moment, but wouldn’t survive a second glance. This is perhaps the biggest problem; Finding a way to really force ourselves to prioritise what actually matters on a daily basis, not just at the quarterly planning or for new year resolutions.

You can just NOT do things. The opposite of the now-hot Silicon Valley phrase, ‘you can just do things,’ is equally applicable to our lives. So much of what we do is out of sheer pressure from what we think society expects from us (society couldn't care less). We add social obligations built around fluff, like attending a gathering just to be polite or watching the latest TV show so we can join the office water-cooler conversation.


In my attempt to improve my focus I tried all the trendy to-do apps and popular techniques like time-boxing, but focus remained tantalisingly out of reach. Almost all the apps focus on getting me to add more things to the list as that counts as engagement, their goals are not aligned with my interests. And techniques as timeboxing did nothing to bring back my focus to what's truly important. 


Recognising these pressures, constraints, and options, I realised the solution wasn’t a more complicated system with progress trackers, reminders, or motivational quotes. Instead, it was something radically simpler. A tool or process that forces focus the same way meditation does: not by doing more, but by returning to what matters. Again and again.

The moment this really clicked for me was when I joined current company and took charge of the their latest product which was their most complex one yet. The team had been building a product for over two years and were still in beta. The key to getting the product launched ended up being the moment when I wrote down 5 priorities on the board and refused to do anything but those for almost 16 months, despite pressure from the every side. Repeating that list of 5 priorities every two weeks in the all-hands. It became a running joke of how obsessed I was with those priorities, but I stayed stubborn.


This wasn’t something I dreamed up one day, rather I was inspired by two stories.

One from Keith Rabois, about Peter Thiel’s management style — where he required that everyone be tasked with exactly one priority. He would refuse to discuss virtually anything else with his people except what was currently assigned as their #1 initiative. Even the annual review forms in 2001 required each employee to identify their single most valuable contribution to the company. 

The other told by Jony Ive about Steve Job. One of the things Steve would say to Jony, because he was worried he wasn’t focused — Steve would say ‘how many things have you said no to?’

Jony would tell him ‘I said no to this. And I said no to that.’

But Steve knew Jony wasn’t interested in doing those things. There was no sacrifice in saying no. 

What focus means is saying no to something that with every bone in your body you think is a phenomenal idea, you wake up thinking about it, but you say no to it because you are focusing on something else.



I built an app on this simple principle: restrict the to-do list itself. This forces a trade-off every single time you want to add something new. The core feature is that it only allows you to have five items on your list at a time. That is it. ['Link to app store'](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/focus-to-do/id6746972162). You can also just use a piece of paper, but as humans we are susceptible to adding the sixth task.

I think of it as applying the centuries old meditation practice to our work and personal life. When we meditate we bring back our focus to our breath, and in the case of this app, we bring back our focus to the truly important tasks, again and again. 

Please don’t use the app for grocery lists! :D
