        <p>Hi All ðŸ‘‹,</p>

        <p>
            This is me, Anant! Welcome to my little corner of the internet. I love to read, think, and write, and I wanted to share my essays in the hope of getting feedback&mdash;so here we are. I have a small private newsletter where I share these essays; if you would like to join, just ping me your email.

        <p>
            A little about me: I am a product manager at Proton, where I helped launch Proton Drive and Proton Docs, and now I also help lead Proton Mail and Proton Calendar. Before Proton, I worked at Yahoo, where I helped launch Daily Fantasy Football in the UK, worked on Yahoo Mail, and for a couple of years led product on Yahoo.com.

        <p>
            When I am not working (which is rare), I love to read, eat, code, and tell dad jokes&mdash;sometimes he laughs (see what I did there :p). I also co-founded a football club and was named one of the hundred most influential people in AI by TIME magazine in 2024. I've lived in India, the UK, the US, and Switzerland.
        </p>

        <p>
            This page is boring&mdash;you should check out the essays section.

        <p>Can be bribed with chocolate cake,</p>
        <p>Anant</p>
