    "snippet": "A few weeks ago, I had an engrossing conversation with a friend regarding their consumption habits. They detailed how they had painstakingly optimized their consumption for learning and how it played a role in their professional and personal life. Intrigued, I raised the question of what they were producing with all the knowledge they were absorbing. We had to cut our discussion short due to time zone difference and we concluded with me suggesting they sell their TV."
